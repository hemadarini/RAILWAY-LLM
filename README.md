Your railway project focuses on developing a large language model (LLM)-based chatbot designed to assist passengers by addressing common issues they face during train travel. The chatbot is trained on a dataset consisting of 60-80 questions related to topics such as cleanliness, safety, and theft. The aim is to provide quick and efficient solutions to passenger concerns through the chatbot's text-based interaction. You're also working on enhancing the user interface (UI) to make it more visually appealing, glossy, and neat, while integrating it with a functional API, such as Google AI Studio, to improve the chatbot's performance and responsiveness.
